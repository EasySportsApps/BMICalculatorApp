## 📝 About BMI Calculator App

BMI Calculator App is an interactive and free web application developed using R Studio and Shiny. It enables healthcare professionals and sports coaches to calculate and monitor the Body Mass Index (BMI) of their patients or athletes for life. The app provides a secure and organized way to store this information. Key features include:
